# Pressure_Loss_and_FBHP_Project
Evaluation of Pressure loss over Hilly Terrains and Development of methodologies to determine FBHP in Directional wells in Multiphase Flow

●	The project aims at implementing a C program that calculates the Pressure Loss over Hilly Terrain in Multiphase Flow.
●	It also plots the various curves: Pressure Traverse Curve, Tubing Intake Curve and Tubing Performance Relationship using MATLAB code.
●	Technologies used : C Programming Language, MATLAB.
